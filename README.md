## Overview

Gaussian Blur is a useful effect to keep in your arsenal when making games, but Unity doesn't ship with a blur that operates on the whole screen uniformly. This repository contains a two-pass post process blur effect which works with URP's volume system and can be customised to different amounts of blurring. The effect uses URP's code-based Renderer Features to work.
